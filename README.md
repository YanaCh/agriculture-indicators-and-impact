## Usage of fertilizers in agricultural needs and their impact on the environment

###### The project aims to investigate main trends in usage of agricultural fertilizers and their impact on the environment.

`FertilizersStatistics.ipynb` reports about:
- **fertilizers indicators** for different regions (Africa, Americas, Europe, Oceania and Asia) summed over the 
  period 1961-2018;
- countries with the highest mean values of **fertilizers indicators** in every region over the period 1961-2018;
- **fertilizers indicators** for different regions changing over the period 1961-2018.

`EmissionsStatistics.ipynb` reports about:
- share of **total emissions** (AR5) in different sectors (Agriculture, Energy, Waste, Industrial processes and product use)
  and regions (Africa, Americas, Europe, Oceania and Asia) changing over time (1990-2017);
- linear dependence of nitrogen nutrient consumption and nitrous oxide **total emissions**.
